**AZERITE: TRACES OF CORRUPTION**

At the dawn of time, there was a singular, celestial force: the **Azerite Stone**. A legendary relic of untold energy, it was the very fabric that shaped the universe. 
Its presence brought balance, yet its true nature remained a mystery, even to the cosmos itself.

Then, an inexplicable event shattered the **Azerite Stone** into countless fragments, releasing a tidal wave of raw cosmic energy. 
These shards scattered across the universe, giving birth to the new world of **Eryndor**—a world where life and death, creation and destruction, became intertwined in an endless struggle.

From the remnants of chaos, six great cities arose, each shaped by the influence of **Azerite** fragments: 
**Luminara, Nyxara, Aetheris, Emberfall, Thalassa, Noctis**.

But beneath the surface, a deeper threat stirs. **Maltherion**, a being consumed by an insatiable hunger for power, has seized a **significant shard** of the **Azerite Stone**. 
With it, he bends the forces of **Eryndor** to his will, spreading corruption and decay. His goal is to reunite the fragments of the **Azerite Stone**, surpass mortal limits, and rule over creation itself.

As the echoes of **Azerite** reverberate across **Eryndor**, ancient powers awaken. The world teeters on the edge of destruction, and once-mighty cities now tremble in fear of an unknown reckoning.

The time has come to uncover the hidden truths of **Azerite**, to confront the darkness that threatens to consume all, and to face the shadows—before they consume everything.
