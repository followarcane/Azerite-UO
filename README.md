**AZERITE: TRACES OF CORRUPTION**

At the dawn of the universe, there existed a singular essence: the *Azerite Stone*, a relic of limitless energy and the fabric that bound creation together. Its presence brought balance, though its true nature was a mystery even to the cosmos itself.

Then, everything changed. An unexplainable event shattered the *Azerite Stone* into countless fragments, unleashing a surge of raw cosmic energy. These fragments scattered across the universe, reshaping and giving birth to a new world—*Eryndor*. This world, infused with the power of *Azerite*, became a place of wonder, danger, and destiny.

Six great cities arose from the chaos, each touched by the cosmic fragments:

**Luminara**, **Nyxara**, **Aetheris**, **Ignarok**, **Thalassa**, **Noctis**

While these cities represent civilization’s resilience, their foundations tremble under the weight of the unknown. One of the largest *Azerite* fragments has fallen into the hands of *Maltherion*, a being consumed by ambition and darkness. With it, he twists the energies of *Eryndor*, spreading corruption and plotting to reunite the shards for his own ascension.

The echoes of *Azerite* reverberate across *Eryndor*. Ancient forces awaken, civilizations teeter, and a great reckoning draws near. The journey to unveil the truth—and face the shadows—is about to begin.
