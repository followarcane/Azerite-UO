**AZERITE: TRACES OF CORRUPTION**

### **The Beginning of the Story**

At the dawn of the universe, at the heart of all creation, there existed an essence: the *Azerite Stone*, a source of limitless energy, the summary of wisdom, and the wellspring of creative power. This stone was an integral part of the fabric of the cosmos, and its presence maintained balance across existence. Yet, the very nature of *Azerite* was too ancient and intricate to be aware of the balance it sustained.

One fateful night, an unexplained event altered everything. A vibration echoed from the depths of the universe, shattering the *Azerite Stone* into countless fragments. This cataclysm unleashed the cosmic energy within, sending shockwaves rippling across the universe. The devastating impact was profoundly felt on a planet later called *Earth*: mountains rose, oceans receded, forests were born and then erased.

However, the fragments of *Azerite* did not merely bring destruction. These cosmic relics gave rise to new civilizations on Earth. Wherever the shards touched, transformation followed: magnificent cities arose, while terrifying creatures emerged elsewhere. But the largest fragment of *Azerite* fell into the hands of a corrupt and power-hungry entity named *Maltherion*.

### **6 Cities and 6 Dungeons**

The world was reshaped around six cities, each influenced by the energy of a shard from the *Azerite Stone*. Though these cities became beacons of civilization, each harbored dangers within their dungeons.

1. **Luminara** (*City of Light*): With golden towers piercing the sky, this city is known as the sanctuary of holy energies. However, within its sacred dungeon lurks *Solarkin*, a lord born of flames.

2. **Nyxara** (*Realm of Shadows*): Hidden within the veils of darkness, this shadowy city has become the center of dark arts. In its dungeon, *Tenebris*, one of the lords of shadow, lies in silent ambush.

3. **Aetheris** (*Kingdom of Air*): Floating among the clouds, this city is famed for its wind-dancing structures. Yet, within its dungeon waits *Zephyrion*, a towering giant of air.

4. **Ignarok** (*Land of Fire and Lava*): Nestled amid volcanoes and fiery plains, this city resembles the inferno itself. In its dungeon lies *Pyronis*, the master of molten fury.

5. **Thalassa** (*Kingdom of Sea and Water*): This city floats atop the vast blue oceans, a temple dedicated to the deity of the seas. *Nautilion*, the dark overlord of the deep dungeon, resides within.

6. **Terra Noctis** (*Realm of Night*): Surrounded by shadowy forests and eerie natural beauty, this city exudes an intimidating charm. In its dungeon, *Umbrowl*, a demon forged from roots, awaits.

### **The Great Threat: Maltherion**

The largest fragment of the *Azerite Stone* has come into the possession of a corrupt being known as *Maltherion*. With this shard, *Maltherion* has cast parts of the world into darkness and has begun plotting to dominate each city. His ultimate goal, however, is to unite all shards of the *Azerite Stone* and ascend to godlike power.

One day, we will inevitably face him to save our world...
